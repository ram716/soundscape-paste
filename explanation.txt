I originally wanted to do something along the lines of a jump-scare at a cabin in the woods. Sitting around a campfire at night while listening to the radio and relaxing with friends and family when a spooky werewolf jumps out. All the files in this update are "rough". This is less of a template of what I wanted and more so something that I had to put together to meet a deadline. Proper recordings and a proper rough draft will be done the upcoming weekend at an actual cabin in the woods. I might keep some of the assets, but I hope to fix the flow of the story and use more personal recordings rather than a mishmash of downloaded ones.

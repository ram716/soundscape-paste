I originally wanted to do something along the lines of a jump-scare at a cabin in the woods. 
Sitting around a campfire at night while listening to the radio and relaxing with friends and family 
when a spooky werewolf jumps out. The project ended up being a mish-mash between sounds recorded at
an actual cabin in the woods, sounds recorded at home, and downloaded sounds. The title "mai-coh"
refers to the term the Navajo used to call witches & wolves, which seemed appropriate considering
the soundscape is supposed to be a general horror story of a werewolf/monster in the US countryside.
